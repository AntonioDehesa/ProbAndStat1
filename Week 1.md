# Case Study - The Polio Trial
We reviewed the case study of the Polio vaccines. 
We first looked at what the meaning of "Significant" could be in a study like this. 
Do we mean statistically significant, or do we mean human-health significant? 
## Meaning of significant
In studies related to human health, an example for statistically significant but not health significant would be two supplements which both possess 
vitamin K, but in different doses. In this case, the difference in doses could be statistically significant, as the difference is unlikely to be repeated by random chance. But it could be not relevant for the health, as the difference in dosis is too small. 

But it could be health significant, but not statistically significant, if there are not enough observations of it. 
It can be statistically significant and not health significant, viceversa, both, or none. 

## What is a Statistic
A statistic itself is just a number calculated from the data without the use of unknown parameters. It helps us answer questions about the data, or summarize aspects of it. But we need to know how well we know something. In other words, precision.
